# Hjem Rum

A module collection for managing your `$HOME` with [Hjem](https://github.com/feel-co/hjem).

## A brief explanation

> \[!IMPORTANT\]
> Hjem, the tooling Hjem Rum is built off of, is still unfinished. Use at your own risk, and beware of bugs, issues, and missing features. If you do not feel like being a beta tester, wait until Hjem is more finished. It is not yet ready to fully replace Home Manager in the average user's config, but if you truly want to, an option could be to use both in conjunction. Either way, as Hjem continues to be developed, Hjem Rum will be worked on as we build modules and functionality out to support average users.

Based on the Hjem tooling, Hjem Rum (literally meaning "home rooms") is a collection of modules for various programs and services to simplify the use of Hjem for managing your `$HOME` files.

Hjem was initially created as an improved implementation of the `home` functionality that Home Manager provides. Its purpose was minimal. Hjem Rum's purpose is to create a module collection based on that tooling in order to recreate the functionality that Home Manager's large collection of modules provides, allowing you to simply install and config a program.

## Setup

> \[!WARNING\]
> Importing Hjem Rum as a NixOS Module is being deprecated in favor of a Hjem Module. While this should not change user-side functionality, it does mean you will need to change where you import Hjem Rum in your config, and how you do so. If you were previously using Hjem Rum with the soon-to-be deprecated NixOS Module (importing it into `imports`), please see below on how to update to the Hjem Module. For more information on why this was done, see [#30](https://github.com/snugnug/hjem-rum/pull/30).

To start using Hjem Rum, you must first import the flake and its modules into your system(s):

```nix
# flake.nix
inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    hjem = {
        url = "github:feel-co/hjem";
        # You may want hjem to use your defined nixpkgs input to
        # minimize redundancies
        inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
    hjem-rum = {
        url = "github:snugnug/hjem-rum";
        # You may want hjem-rum to use your defined nixpkgs input to
        # minimize redundancies
        inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
};

# One example of importing the module into your system configuration
outputs = {
    self,
    nixpkgs,
    ...
} @ inputs: {
    nixosConfigurations = {
        default = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
            specialArgs = {inherit inputs;};
            modules = [
                # Import the hjem module
                inputs.hjem.nixosModules.default
                # Whatever other modules you are importing
            ];
        };
    };
}
```

Be sure to first set the necessary settings for Hjem and import the Hjem module from the input:

```nix
# configuration.nix
hjem = {
    # Importing the modules
    extraModules = [
        inputs.hjem-rum.hjemModules.default
    ];
    # Configuring your user(s)
    users.<username> = {
        enable = true;
        directory = "/home/<username>";
        user = "<username>";
    };
    # You should probably also enable clobberByDefault at least for now.
    clobberByDefault = true;
};
```

You can then configure any of the options defined in this flake in any nix module:

```nix
# configuration.nix
hjem.users.<username>.rum.programs.alacritty = {
    enable = true;
    #package = pkgs.alacritty; # Default
    settings = {
        window = {
            dimensions = {
                lines = 28;
                columns = 101;
            };
            padding = {
                x = 6;
                y = 3;
            };
        };
    };
}
```
