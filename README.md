A module collection for managing your `$HOME` with [Hjem].

## A brief explanation

> [!IMPORTANT]

Based on the Hjem tooling, Hjem Rum (literally meaning "home rooms") is a
collection of modules for various programs and services to simplify the use of
Hjem for managing your `$HOME` files.

Hjem was initially created as an improved implementation of the `home`
functionality that Home Manager provides. Its purpose was minimal. Hjem Rum's
purpose is to create a module collection based on that tooling in order to
recreate the functionality that Home Manager's large collection of modules
provides, allowing you to simply install and config a program.

## Setup

> [!WARNING]
> Importing Hjem Rum as a NixOS Module is being deprecated in favor of a Hjem
> Module. While this should not change user-side functionality, it does mean you
> will need to change where you import Hjem Rum in your config, and how you do
> so. If you were previously using Hjem Rum with the soon-to-be deprecated NixOS
> Module (importing it into `imports`), please see below on how to update to the
> Hjem Module. For more information on why this was done, see [#30].

To start using Hjem Rum, you must first import the flake and its modules into
your system(s):

```nix
# flake.nix
inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    hjem = {
        url = "github:feel-co/hjem";
        # You may want hjem to use your defined nixpkgs input to
        # minimize redundancies.
        inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
    hjem-rum = {
        url = "github:snugnug/hjem-rum";
        # You may want hjem-rum to use your defined nixpkgs input to
        # minimize redundancies.
        inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
        # Same goes for hjem, to avoid discrepancies between the version
        # you use directly and the one hjem-rum uses.
        inputs.hjem.follows = "hjem";
    };
};

# One example of importing the module into your system configuration
outputs = {
    self,
    nixpkgs,
    ...
} @ inputs: {
    nixosConfigurations = {
        default = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
            specialArgs = {inherit inputs;};
            modules = [
                # Import the hjem module
                inputs.hjem.nixosModules.default
                # Whatever other modules you are importing
            ];
        };
    };
}
```

Be sure to first set the necessary settings for Hjem and import the Hjem module
from the input:

```nix
# configuration.nix
hjem = {
    # Importing the modules
    extraModules = [
        inputs.hjem-rum.hjemModules.default
    ];
    # Configuring your user(s)
    users.<username> = {
        enable = true;
        directory = "/home/<username>";
        user = "<username>";
    };
    # You should probably also enable clobberByDefault at least for now.
    clobberByDefault = true;
};
```

You can then configure any of the options defined in this flake in any nix
module:

```nix
# configuration.nix
hjem.users.<username>.rum.programs.alacritty = {
    enable = true;
    #package = pkgs.alacritty; # Default
    settings = {
        window = {
            dimensions = {
                lines = 28;
                columns = 101;
            };
            padding = {
                x = 6;
                y = 3;
            };
        };
    };
}
```

## Environmental Variables

Hjem provides attribute set "environment.sessionVariables" that allows the user
to set environmental variables to be sourced. However, Hjem does not have the
capability to actually source them. This can be done manually, which is what
Hjem Rum tries to do.

Currently, some of our modules may add environmental variables (such as our GTK
module), but cannot load them without the use of another module. Currently,
modules that load environmental variables include:

- [programs/fish]
- [programs/zsh]
- [programs/hyprland]

If you are either using something like our GTK module, or are manually adding
variables to `environment.sessionVariables`, but are neither loading those
variables manually, or using one of the above modules, those variables will not
be loaded, and may cause unintended problems. For example, GTK applications may
not respect your theme, as some rely on the environmental variable to actually
use the theme you declare.

Please see [#17] for status on providing support for shells and compositors. If
your shell or compositor is on listed there, please leave a comment and it will
be added. You are encouraged to open a PR to help support your shell or
compositor if possible.
